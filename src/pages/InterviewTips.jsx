          Most interviewers aren't looking for a perfect answer. They're looking
          for something real. Be honest about how you discovered dentistry, what
          parts of it specifically interest you (e.g., long-term patient
          relationships, public health, surgical precision), and what moments
          made you feel like ‚Äúthis is the right fit.‚Äù

          Whether you shadowed one general dentist or explored multiple
          specialties, you should be able to speak meaningfully about what you
          observed. It‚Äôs less about how much you saw and more about how you
          processed it. What surprised you? What challenged your assumptions?

          Be ready to talk about communication and trust
        </h4>
        <p className="mt-1 text-lg text-gray-700">
          Dentists work closely with people who are often anxious or in pain.
          You may get questions about how you‚Äôd handle a nervous patient,
          explain a difficult procedure, or work with someone who doesn‚Äôt
          follow through on care. Think of times you've built trust or

        <p className="mt-1 text-lg text-gray-700">
          You probably won‚Äôt be asked about drilling a tooth, but you will be
          asked about how you function in teams. Think about school projects,
          work experiences, or volunteer settings where collaboration,
          reliability, or conflict resolution came up.

          You don‚Äôt need to know whether you‚Äôll specialize or stay in general
          practice. You just need to show curiosity, teachability, and that
          you‚Äôve started thinking about your place in the profession.

          It‚Äôs a common question, especially since some applicants start pre‚Äëmed

          Most applicants shadow a lot. What separates you is your reflection.
          What did you learn about working with people in pain? About building
          trust over time? About motivating someone who wants to give up? These

          PTs deal with patients at their most frustrated, vulnerable, or

          patient who‚Äôs not making progress?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow would you respond to
